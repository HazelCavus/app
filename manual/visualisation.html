<h4><a name="Layout" id="Layout"></a>Layout algorithms</h4>
<p class="text">
SocNetV implements special algorithms to layout the network so that each node has a position that reflects her centrality status, index or rank. 
</p>
<p class="text">
You  can apply these algorithms from the menu "Layout" or by clicking on the checkboxes on the left dock. 
Not all layouts methods appear on the dock though.
</p>
<p class="text">
A variety of layout methods are supported. Most of them are based on centralities, while others follow energy models (such as spring-embedder). The former reposition  all  nodes in circles or levels, so that more central nodes appear near the centre or the top of the canvas, respectively. 
</p>

<h4><a name="Circular" id="Circular"></a>Circular Layout</h4>
<p class="text">
Circular layout means that nodes will be repositioned onto the circumferences of concentric circles of different radiuses. 
Circles of smaller radius hold nodes of greater centrality. Thus, more central nodes will be positioned closer to the centre of the canvas. 

Please note that this kind of layout does not take care of crossing links. 
It is only meaningful as a visual representation of the status of each node.

<h4><a name="Level" id="Level"></a>Level Layout</h4>
      
<p class="text">
In level layout methods the nodes are repositioned into levels of different height. More central nodes appear at the top of the screen.

<em>Spring Embedder </em>
<br />
The Spring Embedder model (Eades, 1984), part of the Force Directed Placement (FDP) family,
embeds a mechanical system in the graph by replacing nodes with rings and edges
with springs which excert forces. In the words of Eades himself:
<br /><br />
<em>"The basic idea is as follows. To embed [lay out] a graph we replace the
vertices by steel rings and replace each edge with a spring to form a
mechanical system . . . The vertices are placed in some initial layout and
let go so that the spring forces on the rings move the system to a minimal
energy state."</em>
<br /><br />
In our implementation, non-connecting nodes are regarded as physical bodies (i.e. rings) which exert
repelling forces to each other, while edges become springs which also excert forces.
<br /><br />
These forces are applied to the nodes iteratively, pulling them closer together or pushing them further apart,
until the system comes to an equilibrium state (node positions do not change anymore).

Note that, following Eades, we do not need to have a faithful simulation;
we can -and we do- apply unrealistic forces in an unrealistic manner.
For instance, instead of the forces described by Hooke's law,
we assume weaker logarithmic forces between connected vertices:
</p>
<p class="code">
forceSpring = c_spring * log10 ( dist / naturalLength );
</p>
<p class="code">
forceRepelling =  c_rep / (dist * dist);
</p>
<p class="text">
where
<br />
c_spring=2
<br />
naturalLength= vertexWidth + qCeil ( qSqrt( screenArea / V ) )
<br />
c_rep=maxLength *  maxLength;
