FIXED
=====
--TODO Transform actors to links //COMMENTED OUT
--TODO edges do not need to be drawed twice...
--FIXME: GraphML files may crash SocNetV.
--FIXME: isSymmetric not functioning (check a-symmetry.net)
--FIXME: When many lines intersect, right-click > removeLink may remove wrong link!
--FIXME: Pajek files may offer adjacency matrix instead lists of links 
--FIXME:

TODO & KNOWN BUGS
=================
--FIXME SocNetV is limited to a maximum of 3000x3000 nodes.
- TODO: CLUSTERING by betweeness, see http://iv.slis.indiana.edu/sw/bc.html
http://tyna.gersteinlab.org/tyna/supp.jsp
-- FIXME FIXME Directed Network (BFS) & Centralities (maxIndex and standard). 
-- FIXME FIXME BFS() causes a crash when you create a new net, then remove/add some edges & nodes and compute Betweeness.
TODO->Filter Links by their weights
TODO->NetLayout is not needed...

--FIXME: Centralities dont work when the network is directed.

- TODO: load network from command line. Then compute something and export it!

- TODO: Web crawler
- NEW: Texts on canvas (i.e. layouts display some text explaining what method is used).

- GROUP Stress & Graph centralities 

- Standard Stress Centrality index.

--TODO: PAJEK Filelists, see cite.net / kocka.net
	/kvadrat.net
