KNOWN BUGS
==========

1: Centralities and Layout by centralities crash SocNetV when network is not connected.  (or 40actors-non-symmetric.net crashes SocNetV)
2: Negative weights break centralities 
3: isSymmetric() not 100% (check a-symmetry.net)
4: Some Graphviz (dot) files do not load. See test2.dot. Cant read when one line and nodes dont appear...
5: GROUP Stress & Graph centralities missing
6: Standard Stress Centrality index missing.


OLD, NOT EASILY FIXED BUT NOT CRITICAL BUGS
===========================================
101: When many lines intersect, right-click > removeLink may remove wrong link!
101: Complex GraphML files may crash SocNetV

TODO
====
--TODO: Filter Links by their weights
--distribution of number of in-/out- links, not just average values.
--filter out links and nodes, maybe also by aggregating them. For example, I wrote a small shell program that, given a node, extracts only the nodes connected to it along with the connections among them.
--ability of processing streams of data (in that case, I will need some decaying function to delete "old", ie not used for long, links and nodes).
--Load nets from database connections.
--TODO: Add additional properties to vertices (i.e. date, class, etc).
--TODO: constrain layout to one direction (i.e. date).

--TODO Transform actors to links //COMMENTED OUT

--TODO: CLUSTERING by betweeness, see http://iv.slis.indiana.edu/sw/bc.html

--TODO: Blockmodelling
- TODO: Web crawler
- TODO: Texts on canvas (i.e. layouts display some text explaining what method is used).
