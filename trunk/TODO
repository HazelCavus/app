KNOW BUGS
========

--FIXME: Centralities and Layout by centralities crash SocNetV when network is not connected.
--FIXME: isSymmetric not functioning well (check a-symmetry.net)
--FIXME: When many lines intersect, right-click > removeLink may remove wrong link!
--FIXME: Weights should be updated when changed and floating point weights should be supported...
--FIXME: Graphviz (dot) files not loaded well. See test2.dot. Cant read when one line and nodes dont appear...

--FIXME: GraphML files may crash SocNetV
--FIXME: 40-actors-non-symmetric crashed on Betweeness centr.
- FIXME: GROUP Stress & Graph centralities missing
- FIXME: Standard Stress Centrality index missing.



TODO
====
--distribution of number of in-/out- links, not just average values.
--filter out links and nodes, maybe also by aggregating them. For example, I wrote a small shell program that, given a node, extracts only the nodes connected to it along with the connections among them.
--ability of processing streams of data (in that case, I will need some decaying function to delete "old", ie not used for long, links and nodes).
--Load nets from database connections.
--TODO: Add additional properties to vertices (i.e. date, class, etc).
--TODO: constrain layout to one direction (i.e. date).
--TODO: Filter Links by their weights
--TODO: Small Worlds.
--TODO Transform actors to links //COMMENTED OUT

--TODO: CLUSTERING by betweeness, see http://iv.slis.indiana.edu/sw/bc.html

--TODO: Blockmodelling
- TODO: Web crawler
- TODO: Texts on canvas (i.e. layouts display some text explaining what method is used).
