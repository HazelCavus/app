KNOW BUGS
========

--FIXME: Centralities and Layout by centralities crash SocNetV when network is not connected.
--FIXME: draw own links (nodes linked to themselves).
--FIXME: isSymmetric not functioning well (check a-symmetry.net)
--FIXME: When many lines intersect, right-click > removeLink may remove wrong link!


--FIXME: GraphML files may crash SocNetV
--FIXME: 40-actors-non-symmetric crashed on Betweeness centr.
--FIXME: Nodes dont appear where user clicks, if the rotation > 0.
- FIXME: GROUP Stress & Graph centralities missing
- FIXME: Standard Stress Centrality index missing.
