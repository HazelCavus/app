VERSION 0.37 (codename "Evros Iceman - You're in the army now...")
------------
- Now uniform random network is really a random process.

- Changing node label is now an "on the fly" process.
- Filtering edges by their weights is now supported.
- Layout by centrality is now more comprehensive:
    A background circle is drawn for every centrality value.

- Messages are multilingual now. Only Spanish support for now.
- Context Menu appears when right-clicking on canvas.
- Layouts by closeness and betweeness centralities now work fine.
- Exporting networks to BMP and PNG format is now supported.



VERSION 0.35 (Jan 22 2005)
------------
- Bug fixes.
- d-regular network support
- Multilingual support. 
- Spanish menu support. Thanks to David De Ugarte. Set locale "es" et voila!




Version 0.34 (JAN 14 2005)
------------
- Countless bug fixes, ie:
    Blank name when blank network is created.
    Loading a network file after Creating New Network had undesirable effectes.
    ASSERT: "i < ..."  when nodes <-> edges
    When removing a link it keeps on reporting it.
- Random network creation
- Row index form (beta)
- Betweeness and closeness centralities now work fine.
    


version 0.33 (22 May 2004)
-------------------------
- Countless bug fixes.

- Betweeness centrality.

- New layouts, by centrality (did not work!).

- Edges' weights can be changed by right-clicking on the edge and selecting the relevant command.

- Matrix algebra: inverse, power, determinant, etc.




version 0.32 (15 May 2004)
---------------------------
- Countless Bug Fixes.

- With a click on the "display database" menu option,
  you can view (and print if you like) the complete Database.

- New Transformation: edges <-> nodes 

- Re-reading Wasserman and Faust is always good. Now reachability works well.
  Distance is really ok. Centralities (informational, etc) are implemented, too.





version 0.31  (May 2004)  
------------------------

- Countless Bug Fixes.

- Clicking on a link causes the StatusBar to display info about the specific link.

- Thanks to QT examples, a simple Help viewer has been incorporated.




version 0.3  (March 2004)
-----------
- Somewhat improved memory mngmt; at least, there are no more segmentation faults :)

- Changed internal representation of links: 
  Every link has a source A and a target actor B.
  The source actor A is 'OutLinked' with the target B, while the latter is 'InLinked' from
  the source actor A. This relationship is denoted as A->B.
  If the target actor B of a link (A->B) is also OutLinked with the source, i.e. B->A, 
  then this (two-way) link is an edge. This relationship is denoted as A<->B.
  Else the (one-way) link is just an arc.
  Thus, this representation is compatible to PAJEK's arcs and edges  (or at least what I
   assume that PAJEK does).

- SocNetV can write adjacency matrix ("sociomatrix") to a text file. <NL: MANDRAKE 9.1>
- SocNetV can write PAJEK-formatted network in a file. It saves the on-screen node
  coordinates as well.

- Some interesting node/actor data are displayed in the Status Bar. Also, 
  tooltips w/ coordinates are known to emerge when you leave the mouse pointer on
   the canvas.

- Right-clicking on a node causes a node-specific menu to popup.

- The statistics menu tries to be more relevant to its name! Now it is
  populated by : density, distance, reachability, diameter, centralities.

- The user can remove any node by the appropriate (context) menu command.
  Edges can also be removed using the relevant menu command. There is no
  mouse interactivity with the edges at the moment.  (April 2004)

- Network components (maximal linked subnets) can be calculated. It can also
  paint the nodes of each component with the same color.




version 0.2
-----------
- Somewhat improved mouse interactivity with vertices.

- Now SocNetV can read even adjacency-matrix network files :-)

- New features: network layout options, rudimentary descr. statistics, etc

- New menu (still inactive): Transform Menu



version 0.1
-----------
- First Version of SocNetV (Feb 2004, in the end of an inexpectably heavy
  winter). Initially i planned to name it something like 'nwd' 
  or snail (social network analysis in Linux), although 
  I cannot even remember what 'nwd' was supposed to meant!

- SocNetV should normally read plain PAJEK-formatted network files. At this
  point, only vertices and edges are supported. Also you can read but you cannot write :(

- Efforts to add mouse interactivity to vertices.

- Separate text editor to view and tickle with the text files.

- SocNetV is unabled to directly save network files, although this can be done
using the esoteric text editor.
