<h4><a name="Layout" id="Layout"></a>Layout algorithms</h4>
<p class="text">
SocNetV implements special algorithms to layout the network so that each node has a position that reflects her centrality status, index or rank. 
</p>
<p class="text">
You  can apply these algorithms from the menu "Layout" or by clicking on the checkboxes on the left dock. 
Not all layouts methods appear on the dock though.
</p>
<p class="text">
A variety of layout methods are supported. Most of them are based on centralities, while others follow energy models (such as spring-embedder). The former reposition  all  nodes in circles or levels, so that more central nodes appear near the centre or the top of the canvas, respectively. 
</p>

<h4><a name="Radial" id="Radial"></a>Radial Layout</h4>
<p class="text">
Radial layout means that nodes will be repositioned onto the circumferences of concentric circles of different radiuses. 
Circles of smaller radius hold nodes of greater centrality. Thus, more central nodes will be positioned closer to the centre of the canvas. 

Please note that this kind of layout does not take care of crossing links. 
It is only meaningful as a visual representation of the status of each node.

<h4><a name="Level" id="Level"></a>Level Layout</h4>
      
<p class="text">
In level layout methods the nodes are repositioned into levels of different height. More central nodes appear at the top of the screen.

<em>Spring Embedder </em>
<br />
In this model, nodes are regarded as physical bodies (i.e. electrons) which exert repelling forces to each other, while edges are springs connecting adjacents nodes. Non-adjacent nodes repel each other while connected nodes are The algorithm continues until the system retains an equilibrium state in which all forces cancel each other.
