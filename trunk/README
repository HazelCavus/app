SocNetV -A Social Networks Visualizer
-------------------------------------

1. Overview
-----------

Social Networks Visualizer (SocNetV) is a graphical and flexible application, 
which allows you to draw and visualize social networks (think mathematical graphs) 
and compute network statistics, i.e. distances, centralities, diameter etc. 

Various network file formats are supported, such as GraphML, Adjacency, Pajek, 
and GraphViz. You can modify an existing network, draw a new network using 
your mouse or have SocNetV create random networks for you.

Furthermore, SocNetV can crawl an internet website for you and create 
the network of its outLinks.

SocNetV is a cross-platform application, developed in C++ programming language using the Qt5 multiplatform library and tools

This means you can compile and run SocNetV on Linux, Mac and Windows. 

SocNetV is Free Software, distributed under the General Public Licence Version 3 
(see the COPYING file for details). 

The application is not a "finished" product. Therefore, 
there is no warranty of efficiency, correctness or usability. 
Nevertheless, we are looking forward to help you if you have any problem. 
See section 6 (bug reporting) below.



3. Installation
---------------

You can install SocNetV by:

a) compiling it from source or 
b) using binary packages.

In either case, you need Qt 5 for versions 1.x 
Most Linux Distros have Qt installed by default.
Windows and OS X users please go to http://qt-project.org to download Qt5 library.
 

If you cannot install Qt5 you can try the 0.x series of SocNetV which work with Qt4. 
Please note that SocNetV uses QtWebKit to display online help. 
QtWebKit has been added to Qt from version 4.4, which means you can't compile 
SocNetV in distros with older releases of Qt.

a) Compile from Source Code
	
To compile from source code, download the tarball archive with the source code 
of SocNetV (you probably already have this :P). 
Then, untar (decompress) the archive using a command like this:

tar zxfv SocNetV-1.X.tar.gz

Then enter the new directory and compile with these commands:

cd socnetv-1.XX
qmake (or qmake-qt5)
make

Now you can install it using:

su -c 'make install' 

or 

sudo make install 

If everything is ok, then you can run SocNetV by entering:

./socnetv


b) Install a binary package (Linux/Mac/Windows)

To install SocNetV from a binary package or an executable for Windows, 
check http://socnetv.sourceforge.net and see if there 
is a package for your operating system. 

You can find versions for Mac on the Internet, although these are 
not supported. See: http://pdb.finkproject.org/pdb/package.php/socnetv-mac


4. Command Line Options
-----------------------
	
SocNetV is primarily a GUI program. Nevertheless, some command line options 
are available. Type:

1) ./socnetv filename.net
   to start snv with network named filename.net loaded.
2) ./socnetv -v
   to print version of snv and exit.
3) ./socnetv -d 
   to enable debugging mode, in which snv prints comprehensive messages about 
   what it is doing.



5. Usage 
--------

For usage documentation, see online help.

Or, when running SocNetV, press F1 to display the SocNetV Manual.

There are some example networks inside the /usr/local/doc/socnetv/net folder.
Just press Ctrl+O, go there  and choose one file.
