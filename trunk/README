SocNetV -A Social Networks Visualiser
-------------------------------------

1. Overview
-----------

Social Networks Visualiser (SocNetV) is a flexible application which allows you 
to draw and visualise social networks (think mathematical graphs) and compute 
network statistics, i.e. distances, centralities, diameter etc. Various network 
file formats are supported, such as GraphML, Adjacency, Pajek, and GraphViz. 
You can modify an existing network, draw a new network using your mouse or have 
SocNetV create random networks for you.

SocNetV is a cross-platform application, developed in Qt4/C++. 
This means you can run in on Linux, Mac and Windows. 
It is Free Software, distributed under the General Public Licence Version 3 
(see COPYING).


2. Installation
---------------

To install this application you need is a working Linux distro, with Qt 4.4+. 
Most distros have these packages installed by default. 
Please note that SocNetV uses QtWebKit to display online help. 
QtWebKit has been added to Qt from version 4.4, which means you can't compile 
SocNetV in distros with older releases of Qt.

If you have Qt 4.4+, you can install SocNetV by compiling it from source or 
using binary packages. 
	
To compile from source code, download the tarball archive with the source code 
of SocNetV (you probably already have this :P). 
Then, untar (decompress) the archive using a command like this:

tar zxfv SocNetV-v0.XX.tar.gz

Then enter the new directory and compile with these commands:

cd socnetv
./configure
make

Now you can install it using:

su -c 'make install' 

or 

sudo make install 

If everything is ok, then you can run SocNetV by entering:

socnetv

To install a binary package, check http://socnetv.sourceforge.net and see if 
there is a package for your distribution. 

You can find versions for Mac and Windows on the Internet, although these are 
not supported.


3. Command Line Options
-----------------------
	
SocNetV is primarily a GUI program. Nevertheless, some command line options 
are available. Type:
1) ./socnetv filename.net
   to start snv with network named filename.net loaded.
2) ./socnetv -v
   to print version of snv and exit.
3) ./socnetv -d 
   to enable debugging mode, in which snv prints comprehensive messages about 
   what it is doing.



4. Usage
