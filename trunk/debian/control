Description: A Social Networks Analyser and Visualiser
 SocNetV (Social Networks Visualiser) is a flexible and
 user-friendly tool for Social Networks Analysis and Visualisation.
 It lets you create new networks (graphs) with a few clicks on a
 virtual canvas or load networks of various formats (GraphViz,
 GraphML, Adjacency, Pajek, etc) and modify them to suit your needs.
 .
 The application can compute network properties, such as density,
 diameter and distances, as well as node and network centralities.
 Various layout algorithms (i.e. Spring-embedder, circular and in
 levels according to centralities) are supported for meaningful
 visualisations of your networks. Furthermore, simple random
 networks (lattice, same degree, etc) can be created.
