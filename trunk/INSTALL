Installation
============

Hello there!

The installation of SocNetV in your Linux box should be straightforward provided you have Qt 4.2+ installed. 

Qt is a C++ toolkit developed by Trolltech and published under GPL. Most modern Linux distros, especially those providing KDE as their default desktop environment, include Qt. So if you have one of openSUSE, Mandriva, Fedora, Kubuntu, Slackware, etc, you dont need to download Qt. It should be already installed. 

If you have Qt installed, all you have to do is to type in the following commands in order to decompress the SocNetV tarball and build it:

1) untar zxfv SocNetV-0.XX.tar.gz

2) cd SocNetV

3) $QTDIR/bin/qmake

4) make

Probably you have already done the first 2 steps, so just type in qmake and make (steps 3 and 4, above).

Afterwards, run the application typing: 

./socnetv

or double-click the socnetv file from you favorite file manager. 

BTW, there are some example networks inside the /net folder. Just press Ctrl+O, click on net folder and choose one.
