Installation
============

To install SocNetV 1.x you need Qt5 development libraries. Qt is a C++ toolkit published under GPL. Most modern Linux distros, especially those providing KDE as their default desktop environment, include Qt. So if you have one of openSUSE, Mandriva, Fedora, Kubuntu, Slackware, etc, you dont need to download Qt. It should be already installed.

If you have Qt5 installed, all you have to do is to type in the following commands in order to decompress the SocNetV tarball and build it. Replace 1.X with the versionyou downloaded...

1) untar zxfv SocNetV-1.X.tar.gz 

2) cd socnetv-1.X

3) qmake

4) make

5) sudo make install

Probably you have already done the first 2 steps, so just type in 'qmake' or 'qmake-qt5'.
If Qt5 is not installed, the script will let you know...

When you finish compiling and installing, run the application typing: 

socnetv

or go to Start Menu > Mathematics  > SocNetV.
