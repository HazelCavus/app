Installation
============

Binaries

SocNetV binary packages are available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux distros.

You can download a binary package for your Operating System from the project
webpage at: http://socnetv.org/downloads

If there is no package for your OS, please download and compile the source code.

Windows

To run SocNetV in Windows, download the latest SocNetV zip for Windows from the 
Downloads page, unzip it, and double-click on the socnetv executable.
The program will run immediately.

Mac OS X

If you are a Mac user, you can download and run SocNetV from a disk image (dmg file). 
From the Downloads page, download the Mac OS .dmg file. 
Once downloaded, double click on it and a new window will appear. 
To run the application, double click on the SocNetV icon holding down the META key.
To install SocNetV, drag the SocNetV icon to your Applications.

Linux

SocNetV is available in most Linux distributions, although not the latest version. 

To install the latest and greatest SocNetV version, users of openSUSE, Fedora and 
Ubuntu/Debian are advised to add our own repositories to their systems.

In Debian and Ubuntu, install SocNetV from our repos with these commands:

sudo add-apt-repository ppa:dimitris-kalamaras/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install socnetv

In Fedora and openSUSE, choose and add the correct repository from here:
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:/oxy86/ 

Once you add the repo, install SocNetV using the command (Fedora):
sudo yum install socnetv

or (openSUSE):
sudo zypper in socnetv


Compile from source code

To compile and install SocNetV from source you need the Qt5 toolkit 
development libraries. Qt is an open source C++ toolkit published under the GPL.
Qt5 is preinstalled in most Linux distributions and it is available for 
Windows and Mac OS X.  If you do not have Qt5 installed, please download and 
install it from https://www.qt.io/developers

Once you have Qt5 installed in your OS, you are ready to compile SocNetV from source.
All you have to do is to type in the following commands in order to decompress the 
SocNetV tarball and build it. Replace 2.X with the version you downloaded.

1) untar zxfv SocNetV-2.X.tar.gz 

2) cd socnetv-2.X

3) qmake

4) make

5) sudo make install

Probably you have already done the first 2 steps, so just type in 'qmake' or 'qmake-qt5'.

When you finish compiling and installing, run the application typing: 

socnetv

or go to Start Menu > Mathematics  > SocNetV.
