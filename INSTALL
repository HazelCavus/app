Installation
============

Binaries

SocNetV binary packages are available for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux distros. 
You can download a binary package for your Operating System from the project 
webpage at: http://socnetv.sourceforge.net

If there is no package for your OS, please download and compile the source code.

Compile from source code

To compile and install SocNetV from source you need the Qt5 toolkit 
development libraries. Qt is an open source C++ toolkit published under the GPL.
Qt5 is preinstalled in most Linux distributions and it is available for 
Windows and Mac OS X.  If you do not have Qt5 installed, please download and 
install it from https://www.qt.io/developers

Once you have Qt5 installed in your OS, you are ready to compile SocNetV from source.
All you have to do is to type in the following commands in order to decompress the 
SocNetV tarball and build it. Replace 2.X with the version you downloaded.

1) untar zxfv SocNetV-2.X.tar.gz 

2) cd socnetv-2.X

3) qmake

4) make

5) sudo make install

Probably you have already done the first 2 steps, so just type in 'qmake' or 'qmake-qt5'.

When you finish compiling and installing, run the application typing: 

socnetv

or go to Start Menu > Mathematics  > SocNetV.
