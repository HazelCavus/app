FIXED
=====
TODO-> Transform actors to links //COMMENTED OUT
--TODO edges do not need to be drawed twice...
--FIXME: GraphML files may crash SocNetV.
--FIXME: isSymmetric not functioning (check a-symmetry.net)
--FIXME: When many lines intersect, right-click > removeLink may remove wrong link!


-- FIXED: Clearing background circles bug.
-- NEW: background layout lines for level layout algorithms
--NEW: There is a new widget enabling the user to rotate the network
--NEW: Nodes may have 4 different shapes: circles, diamonds, triangles, boxes and ellipses are supported.
--FIXED: Crashes when loading pajek file with nodes having labels with dots inside. 
--FIXED: There was a bug in Qt 4.3 QGraphicsView causing redraw delays. Is fixed in Qt 4.4 :)
--FIXED: New zooming widget replaces old and untrustworthy one
--FIXED: Cosmetic changes, i.e. new icons, new layout for the sidebar, 
--FIXED: Code clean-up in MainWindows Class and Matrix. Deleted obsolete members and functions such as nodeExists(), mousePosGW(), Dijkstra, etc. Commented out messageboxes when networks are loaded.)




TODO & KNOWN BUGS
=================
--FIXME Matrix class declares a maximum of 1500x1500 in the constructor. So if we compute something with BFS() for a bigger network, a crash will most definitely occur... 
- TODO: CLUSTERING by betweeness, see http://iv.slis.indiana.edu/sw/bc.html
http://tyna.gersteinlab.org/tyna/supp.jsp
-- FIXME FIXME Directed Network (BFS) & Centralities (maxIndex and standard). Crashes must be stopped! 
-- FIXME FIXME BFS() causes a crash when you create a new net, then remove/add some edges & nodes and compute Betweeness.
TODO-> for() loops should not exist in MW. Move all computations away...

TODO->Filter Links by their weights
TODO->NetLayout is not needed...

--FIXME: Centralities dont work when the network is directed.
--FIXME: At last, do something for sceneRect etc.

--FIXME: graphicsWidget removeItem is called from clear()..is this good?

- FIXME: CreatePhysLattice then add links, then layout closeness then calc betweeness CRASHES!

+ Add GraphML (XML) support. See visone documents. DL package.


- TODO: load network from command line. Then compute something and export it!
- TODO: XML. List and .DOT Import/Export, with shapes
- TODO: Web crawler
- TODO: hash maps
- NEW: Texts on canvas (i.e. layouts display some text explaining what method is used).

- GROUP Stress & Graph centralities 

- Standard Stress Centrality index.

- FIXME: Export to a format does not ask for a filename if the network is loaded from a file.

- FIXME: fileSaved is obsolete.

--TODO: PAJEK Filelists, see cite.net / kocka.net
	/kvadrat.net
