KNOWN BUGS
==========

1: Negative weights break centralities
2: UCINET (DL) files in nodelist1 format (one-mode) are not supported.  
3: isSymmetric() not 100% (check a-symmetry.net)
4: Some Graphviz (dot) files do not load. See test2.dot. Cant read when one line and nodes dont appear...
7: SocNetV cannot load GraphML files with node labels which contain the & character. 
8: 2014-02-28: In Reciprocal links with diferrent weight, only the first weight is taken into account
9: closeness reports wrong indices in digraphs, where one actor has only one outLink
10: fix other related indices for digraphs when d(i,j) = inf

OLD, NOT EASILY FIXED BUT NOT CRITICAL BUGS
===========================================
101: When many lines intersect, right-click > removeLink may remove wrong link!
